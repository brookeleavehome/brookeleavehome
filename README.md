# What is Brooke Leave Home?
Brooke Leave Home is a personalized film designed to engage a non-expert audience with open data about the support young adults receive when leaving the care system in England. The film draws upon a range of video-based data storytelling techniques to present each viewer with a personalized perspective on the topic based on data from their own local area. You can [watch the film here](http://brookeleavehome.github.io) (we reccommend you use Chrome on a desktop or laptop computer).

The film was created as as a storytelling experiment as part of the [EPSRC Perspective Media project](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=EP%2FR010919%2F1) at the University of York's [Digital Creativity Labs](http://www.digitalcreativity.ac.uk). This project investigated whether personalised video stories could be used to presenting data sources to the public in a way that a large and diverse section of the population would be able to, and equally crucially, want to use.

You can find out more about the film, why it is designed the way it is and, crucially, what audiences thought of it in a research study in this [research paper](./docs/blh_preprint.pdf). You can also find out about other interactive videos that have included data in related ways [in this paper](./docs/pm_preprint.pdf).

## What do you mean when you say personalized film?

The film tells the story of Brooke, a fictional care leaver as she begins life on her own in the months following her 18th birthday. A key feature of the film is that, while all viewers see a story progressing through the same acts, the content and narrative structure shown within them changes depending on data about care leaver support in the viewerâ€™s local authority area. In short, what happens to Brooke in the film changes based on data about the location you choose from the drop down menu on the front page. In order to ensure that the the character of Brooke, her story and its relationship with the data sources included were constructed in an authentic way, we collaborated with [Inspired Youth](http://inspiredyouth.org) who are a not-for-profit social enterprise with expertise in working with care leavers.

## What data sources is the film based on?

The film adapts it's content and structure based on [data](./data) from the following sources:

- Number of care leavers in England by local authority (source: Children's Society)
- Setting up home grant allowance by local authority (source: Children and Young People Now)
- Estimated setting up home cost, itemized basket of goods (source: Care Leavers' Foundation)
- Council tax exemption for care leavers by local authority (source: Children's Society)
- Council tax rates by local authority (source: UK Government)

It's important to note that the situation illustrated by these data sources may have changed since the film's production in 2019, and has in particular due to legislation that has brought the Setting Up Home Allowance amount given to care leavers across the country into alignment. Therefore, we ask that you view this film as a experimental prototype illustrating how a personalised film could be used to present data in a new way, rather than a currently accurate depiction of the financial support care leavers receive.

## What technology did we use?

The film was created using the Cutting Room interactive film authoring toolkit. The current Unity-based version of Cutting Room is available as an open source project at [this repository](https://github.com/Digital-Creativity-Labs/CuttingRoom/). For Brooke Leave Home, we used an older HTML5-based version of the toolkit that isn't currently available. However, if you are interested in using this version of the toolkit then please do [get in contact](mailto:jonathab.hook@york.ac.uk).
