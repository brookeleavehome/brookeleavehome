# What is Brooke Leave Home?
Brooke Leave Home is a personalized film designed to engage a non-expert audience with open data about the support young adults receive when leaving the care system in England. The film draws upon a range of video-based data storytelling techniques to present each viewer with a personalized perspective on the topic based on data from their own local area.

The film was created as as a storytelling experiment as part of the [EPSRC Perspective Media project](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=EP%2FR010919%2F1) at the University of York's [Digital Creativity Labs](http://www.digitalcreativity.ac.uk). This project investigated whether personalised video stories could be used to presenting data sources to the public in a way that a large and diverse section of the population would be able to, and equally crucially, want to use.

You can find out more about the film, why it is designed the way it is and, crucially, what audiences thought of it in a research study in this [research paper](./docs/blh_preprint.pdf). You can also find out about other interactive videos that have included data in related ways [in this paper](./docs/pm_preprint.pdf).

## What do you mean when you say personalized film?

The film tells the story of Brooke, a fictional care leaver as she begins life on her own in the months following her 18th birthday. A key feature of the film is that, while all viewers see a story progressing through the same acts, the content and narrative structure shown within them changes depending on data about care leaver support in the viewerâ€™s local authority area.
