# What is Brooke Leave Home?
Brooke Leave Home is a personalized film designed to engage a non-expert audience with open data about the support young adults receive when leaving the care system in England. The film draws upon a range of video-based data storytelling techniques to present each viewer with a personalized perspective on the topic based on data from their own local area.

The film was created as as a storytelling experiment as part of the [EPSRC Perspective Media project](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=EP%2FR010919%2F1). This project investigated whether personalised video stories could be used to presenting data sources to the public in a way that a large and diverse section of the population would be able to, and equally crucially, want to use.

You can find out more about the film, why it is designed the way it is, the data sources that it depends on and, crucially, what audiences thought of it in a research study in this [research paper](./docs/blh_preprint.pdf). You can also find out about other interactive videos that have included data in related ways [in this paper](./docs/pm_preprint.pdf).
